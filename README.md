# Setup Gatsby Site
The site we will be developing is a blog. This fits the tech stack used, because often use a Content Management System (CMS) like Contentful to pull data from. We also want to have our site dynamically builed when we create new posts. We'll do all this in this tutorial!

## Install Gatsby CLI
Gatsby comes with a slick CLI that helps you generate new applications. Before creating your first project, install gatsby-cli globally.

`npm i -g gatsby-cli`

## Create new site
Gatsby is a static site generator that it built on top of react. At build time, Gatsby reaches out to all your data sources (markdown files, json, yaml, WordPress, Contentful, etc) and puts it in the graphQL data layer. Creating a new project will set you up with the basic stack you'll need to get started. 

`gatsby new gatsby-contentful`

# Initial Commit:
This is auto-generated from Gatsby when you create your site.

## Startup Server
Navigate into the folder you created your site in.

`cd gatsby-contentful`

Gatsby has it's own commands. If you're used to `npm run start`, don't fret, they aliased that for ya ðŸ˜‰

`gatsby develop`

Investigate the starter site! There are lots of starters available on the Gatsby website. For now we're going to start with the basic starter by editing the main page (index.js) and page-2 before creating contentful.

## Change index.js
We're not going to change a whole lot here. The most important part is that the `<Link>` at the bottom of the page gets changed from `page-2` to `blogposts`. Update the file `pages/index.js` with the following.

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import Image from "../components/image"
import SEO from "../components/seo"
import "./index.css"

const IndexPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <SEO title="Home" keywords={[`gatsby`, `application`, `react`]} />
    <div className="home">
      <h1>Hello There</h1>
      <p>Welcome my awesome blog</p>
      <div>
        <div
          style={{
            maxWidth: `300px`,
            margin: "0 auto 1.45rem",
          }}
        >
          <Image />
        </div>
      </div>
      <Link to="/blogposts/">View all posts</Link>
    </div>
  </Layout>
)

export default IndexPage
```

## Add index.css
Create a file in the `pages` directory named `index.css`. You probably noticed we imported that in `index.js`. 

This tutorial is focused on loading data from our CMS through Gatsby and not design. I'll provide a style sheet for you later in this tutorial but will not go into depth on what it does.

## Change Page-2 to Blogposts
Change the name of `page-2.js` to `blogposts.js`. This is where we'll list all of the blogs from Contetnful after we hook it up with a Gatsby plugin.

## Update Site Meta Data
Navigate to the file `gatsby-config.js` and update `siteMetadata` with your own information:

```js
siteMetadata: {
  title: `My Awesome Blog`,
  description: `An awesome place where all my posts live`,
  author: `YOUR_NAME`,
}
```

# Commit 2:
Update homepage, rename page-2 to blogposts, and update siteMetadata

# Setup Contentful

## Create Account
Head to [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and create an account. You can do this with a 3rd party login (google, github, etc.) or with a username and password.

You'll be provided with options to explore or create a 3-step site. While Contentful has an awesome tutorial, choose to explore to continue following this

![explore, don't create 3 step site](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/1-explore.png)

## Create Space
You will probably be created a `contentful-starter` space. Go ahead and click that left hand header to open up a sidenav that will allow you to create a new space:

![open contentful sidenav](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398340/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/2-sidenav.png)

![create new space](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/3-new-space.png)

Notice the free tier limitations.

![create new space](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/4_-free-tier.png)

![create gatsby space](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398340/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/5-create-gatsby-contful-space.png)

## Create Content Model

Go to `Content model` on the top nav. Then click this "Add Content Type" in the center of the screen. Name the content type `Blog Post`. Leave the identifier alone and create any description if you'd like.

![create content model](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/6-create-content-model.png)

You'll notice a button to the side to "(+) Add Field". Fields act as data entries on your model and can be of a variety of types.

- Click on **Add Field** start adding fields to your model.
- Select **Text** for your first field.

![chose text field](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/7-field-options.png)

-Put Title as its name, leave it as a short text and click create.

![create title field](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/8-title-text.png)

- Create another field for **Body** and make this one a **Long Text** field.

![create body field](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/9-create-body.png)

- Create a **Media** field and label it as **Image**
- Create another text field and name it tags. Make sure to check the list option on the right.

![create tags field](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.5/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/10-tags.png)

- Create a final **Text** field for **Slug**. Instead of clicking create, click **Create and Configure** and do the following: - Go to **Appearance Tab** and select **Slug**. - Go to **Validations** and select **Required** and **Unique**. The slug field is the final part of the URL path that will lead to your post, so we want it to be unique (no two posts can have the same URL)

![click create and configure](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/11-slug-field.png)

![appearance as slug](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/12-slug-appearance.png)

![validations as unique](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/13-slug-validations.png)

## Final Model Format

In the end, you should have the following fields on your blog:

![final blog fields](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/14-finished-blogpost-content-model.png)

Save changes and then let's start creating content.

## Add Content To Model (Create Some Blog Posts)

On the top nav menu, go to **Content** and click the blue button **Add Blog Post** to start generating content.

Create three new posts with placeholder data (or your own content if you have it). Feel free to use the following resources to help:

- [Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/) for filler content
- [Upsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for open source photos

# Storing API Keys

We are going to use environment variables to store our API tokens. By placing the environment file in our `.gitignore` we'll keep our keys secret.

For full details, see the [Gatsby Documentation on Environment Variables](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/environment-variables/) in Gatsby.

## Create Environment File

In the root directory of your project create a new file: `.env.development`

Before we forget, navigate to `.gitignore` and add the `.env.development` to the list. The new file you created should turn from green to grey if your text editor has git integration.

Open `.env.development` and add the following fields with placeholders for now:

```
SPACE_ID=[your space id placeholder]
API_KEY=[your API token placeholder]
```

Now let's go find the variables to put in the placeholders.

For Space ID, go to **Settings** in the top navigation, then down to **General Settings**. Place your Space ID in the environment file.

![General settings for Space ID](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/15-general-settings.png)

You will need to create an API key by going to the **Settings** top navigation and go down to **API keys**. Create a new API Key. Label it with your blog name and copy your **Content Delivery API** token to your **.env.development** file.

![API settings for API Key](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/16-settings-api-keys.png)

## Install Contentful Plugin To Gatsby

To load our post model data from Contentful into Gatsby, we will install and configure a Gatsby plugin:
`npm install gatsby-source-contentful`

Then head back to `gatsby-config.js` and below your site metadata, configure the plugin. First you will need to load your environment file, then configure your plugin with the information from it.

```javascript
require("dotenv").config({
  path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`,
})

module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Awesome Blog`,
    description: `An awesome place where all my posts live`,
    author: `@micLeners`,
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-contentful`,
      options: {
        spaceId: process.env.SPACE_ID,
        accessToken: process.env.API_KEY,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`,
// ... file truncated ...
```

# Commit 3:

Add environment variables, install contentful plugin and configure.

# Query GraphQL

Build your project and navigate to the second link. This will open up GraphiQL, an interface that lets you investigate and query the graph layer.

Enter the following query into the lefthand panel and run with the play button:

```
{
  allContentfulBlogPost{
    edges {
      node {
        id
        slug
        title
        tags
        image {
          file {
            url
          }
        }
        contentful_id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If all worked, you should see your blog data in JSON format on the right. How this has happened is `gatsby-contentful-plugin` makes a call to Contentful when Gatsby builds. It uses the API Key and Space ID you provided to access the data in the models. It then semantically names fields to be accessible over GraphQL.

# Templating and Displaying Posts

We want to build out post pages from the content data in our model. We will do this using Gatsby's Node API. It will fetch all our data from the content and create separate pages for them.

Navigate to the `gatsby-node.js` file and update it with the following:

```javascript
const path = require(`path`)
const slash = require(`slash`)
exports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions
  // we use the provided allContentfulBlogPost query to fetch the data from Contentful
  return graphql(
    `
      {
        allContentfulBlogPost {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `
  )
    .then(result => {
      if (result.errors) {
        console.log("Error retrieving contentful data", result.errors)
      }
      // Resolve the paths to our template
      const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve("./src/templates/blogpost.js")
      // Then for each result we create a page.
      result.data.allContentfulBlogPost.edges.forEach(edge => {
        createPage({
          path: `/blogpost/${edge.node.slug}/`,
          component: slash(blogPostTemplate),
          context: {
            slug: edge.node.slug,
            id: edge.node.id,
          },
        })
      })
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log("Error retrieving contentful data", error)
    })
}
```

Then we will need to create a `template` directory in our `src` folder named `blogpost.js`: `./src/templates/blogpost.js`

Update this file with the following content:

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { Link, graphql } from "gatsby"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import SEO from "../components/seo"
const BlogPost = ({ data }) => {
  const { title, body, image, tags } = data.contentfulBlogPost
  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title={title} />
      <div className="blogpost">
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <img alt={title} src={image.file.url} />
        <div className="tags">
          {tags.map(tag => (
            <span className="tag" key={tag}>
              {tag}
            </span>
          ))}
        </div>
        <p className="body-text">{body.body}</p>
        <Link to="/blogposts">View more posts</Link>
        <Link to="/">Back to Home</Link>
      </div>
    </Layout>
  )
}
export default BlogPost
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query($slug: String!) {
    contentfulBlogPost(slug: { eq: $slug }) {
      title
      slug
      body {
        body
      }
      image {
        file {
          url
        }
      }
      tags
    }
  }
`
```

Lets go back to our `pages/blogposts.js` file and update it with a list of our blogposts:

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { Link, graphql } from "gatsby"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import SEO from "../components/seo"
const BlogPosts = ({ data }) => {
  const blogPosts = data.allContentfulBlogPost.edges
  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title="Blog posts" />
      <h1>{"Here's a list of all blogposts!"}</h1>
      <div className="blogposts">
        {blogPosts.map(({ node: post }) => (
          <div key={post.id}>
            <Link to={`/blogpost/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
          </div>
        ))}
        <span className="mgBtm__24" />
        <Link to="/">Go back to the homepage</Link>
      </div>
    </Layout>
  )
}
export default BlogPosts
export const query = graphql`
  query BlogPostsPageQuery {
    allContentfulBlogPost(limit: 1000) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          slug
          body {
            body
          }
          image {
            file {
              url
            }
          }
          tags
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Lastly, let's update the styling of our site a bit. In `pages/index.css` add the following:

```css
@import url("<https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,400,600>");

html {
  font-family: "Open Sans";
}

header {
  /* We use !important here to override
  the inline styles just for this example.
  in production code, avoid using it where
  possible*/
  background-color: cadetblue !important;
}

header div {
  text-align: center;
}

header div h1 {
  font-weight: 600;
}

.home {
  text-align: center;
}

.home img {
  margin: auto;
}

.blogpost {
  font-size: 18px;
  width: 35em;
}

h1 {
  font-weight: 400;
  margin-top: 48px;
  font-family: "Open Sans";
}

img {
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

.tags {
  margin-bottom: 24px;
}

.tags span.tag {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-right: 8px;
  background: cadetblue;
  padding: 2px 12px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  color: white;
  font-size: 12px;
}

.blogpost p.body-text {
  margin-bottom: 32px;
}

p {
  line-height: 1.8;
  color: #929191;
  font-weight: 300;
}

.blogpost a {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

.blogposts a {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

footer {
  margin-top: 120px;
}

.mgBtm__24 {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
}
```

# Commit 4:

Load posts through node-api, create template, update blogposts.js and styling

Push your code up to your Github page by creating a new github repo (don't create a readme). Copy the github URL and in your local terminal run the command:
`git remote add origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`

Then push with:
`git push origin master`

# Deploy To Netlify

If you don't have a profile on Netlify, create one now.

- On your main page, click the green **New site from Git** button on the top right.
- Under continuous deployment, click **Github**
- During the setup, you can choose to either allow all sites to be deployed, or just some. If you choose only some, make sure you add the repo you pushed `gatsby-contentful` to your deploy list
- Select the repo that you pushed your work to and click deploy with the default settings

![gatsby deploy settings on netlify](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/17-gatsby-deploy-settings.png)

## Environment Varialbes

Oh, no! You'll notice that your deploy failed. Let's see why be clicking the `Site deploy failed` status and navigate to the deploy that failed.

![deploy failed](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/18-deploy-failed.png)

Scroll through the log and you'll see a bunch of successes and then an `error`. With the output:

```
4:24:35 PM: Problems with gatsby-source-contentful plugin options:
4:24:35 PM: spaceId: undefined - "spaceId" is required
4:24:35 PM: accessToken: undefined - "accessToken" is required
```

Our `gatsby-source-contentful` plugin failed to initiate correctly because we didn't include our environment variables. Luckily, Netlify provides an easy way to plug these in.

- Scroll up to the top and click the `Deploy settings` button

![deploy settings button](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/19-deploy-settings.png)

- Click on environment in the left hand menu

![select environment from left hand nav](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/20-envirenment-menu-item.png)

- Click edit variables

![edit variables button](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/21-edit-variables.png)

- Then enter your tokens the same as key and values as you did in your `.env.development` file:

![enter-environment-variables](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/22-enter-environment-variables.png)

Scroll up to the top navigation menu item named `Deploys`. Then in the middle where your deploys are listed drop down `Trigger deploy` and select `Deploy Site`.

![redeploy-site](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_700/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/23-redeploy-site.png)

# Create Contentful Hook

We can create a hook to trigger our website to build every time we publish new data. In the `Deploy settings` again (under `Build & deploy`) find the section labeled `Build hooks`

![build hooks section](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_700/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/24-add-build-hook.png)

Create a new webhook. I'm calling mine `Contentful`. Then navigate to your Contentful space and under **Settings**, go down to **Webhooks**

![webhooks in contentful](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/25-webhooks-menu-item.png)

You'll notice on the right there are already pre-built options including one for Netlify. Click **Add** by Netlify and paste in the URL

![Netlify webhook](https://res.cloudinary.com/meta-lark-design/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/v1570398343/mike-portfolio/gatsby-contentful-netlify/26-netlify-webhooks.png)
